# Background

For years, I have collected and repurposed old laptops and desktops for my own uses. I will describe each one, and the software that I use to manage them all.

## server1

My first server is a Dell Optiplex 7010 from a computer lab. It originally ran Windows 8, and now it runs Ubuntu desktop version 20.04. I added an nvidia graphics card for CUDA programs and better desktop graphics, as it is the only server that has a display, and an extra RAM stick to get it up to 20GB.

 - Software: Octoprint, [LACS hub](https://github.com/Snapwhiz914/LACS), Portainer node

## server2

The next server is a Dell studio 1555. Like server1, it originally ran Windows 8 and now runs Ubuntu server 20.04. I still use it with the original specs (2.1 GHZ intel core, 4 GB RAM) and have run into no troubles with it. The hardware itself lies inside of its original case, with the laptop screen taken out

 - Software: PiHole, [PN-API](https://github.com/Snapwhiz914/PN-API), [LACS node](https://github.com/Snapwhiz914/LACS-node), Portainer Node

## server3

This server was a proof of concept project, proving that Linux can run on anything. It originally ran Windows 98, and now has Debian 11 headless installed. The onboard HDD is in poor condition, so I do not run this server very often.

## server 4

My friend's retired school laptop, a Lenovo ideapad 330s. The first server that originally ran Windows 10, now runs Ubuntu server 20.04. I live in an area with frequent power outages, and server4's battery can usually make it through 1-2 hours of no supply power. I consider it my most reliable server, which is why I run all exposed web services through it as a reverse proxy to secure connections. Like server2, the hardware lies in its original case with the screen removed.

 - Software: MongoDB, [LACS node](https://github.com/Snapwhiz914/LACS-node), Changedetector.io, NGINX (reverse proxy), Portainer node

## server 5

When this server was my brother's gaming laptop, the original graphics card failed and had to be replaced. At that point, he had gotten a new laptop, so he gave it to me. Tied with server1 for most powerful, it has an 16 GB DDR4 laptop RAM and 8 core 2.5 GHZ processor. The screen was originally planned to stay, however it seemed to break at the same time that the graphics card did, so it too is headless.

- Software: Minecraft server (forge, rlcraft, spigot), [LACS node](https://github.com/Snapwhiz914/LACS-node), Portainer Hub

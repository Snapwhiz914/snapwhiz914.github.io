My name is Liam Loughead, and I enjoy writing code for anything that can be programmed, as well as creating something to be programmed. My interests span from robotics to game design to networking utilities. Here you'll find posts that give some insight into the various projects that are on my [github](https://github.com/Snapwhiz914). I'll explain my motivation, explanations of my thought process, and outcomes - anything you wouldn't find in a repository's README.

Since I've only recently (as of 2024) started this blog, I have numerous projects that lie undocumented on GitHub and on my PC. Dates on these posts will not correspond with the actual time of their making. If the date is relevant then I will mention it in the post.
 - Projects that were committed to GitHub before I started this blog will have their title prefixed with "Initial Commit: "
 - Projects that are not on GitHub but deserve a post will have their title prefixed with "Uncommitted: "
 - Small projects or ideas will have their title prefixed with "Gist: "
